Two new major features in Hayaku:

1. Value Cycling.
2. User-defined dictionaries.


## Value Cycling

You can now use `alt ↓` and `alt ↑` to cycle any numbers, dates or CSS values.

While there are other plugins doing similar thing, Hayaku excells at it:

- You don't need to place a cursor at the number.
  Hayaku finds the closest number to the cursor in the line and changes it.

  Try it there: `43, 32167, foobar (46px) -2.5`.

- You can increment a number by selecting a part of it.
  Hayaku would increment the whole number based on the context.

  Try in there: `10000, -19999, 3.1415926`

- Hayaku keeps the position of the cursor inside a value, so you won't lose the focus.

- Hayaku perfectly handles multiple cursors.

  Try in by placing multiple cursors at the above examples.

- You can increment multiple lines at once
  (only the first number on each line would be affected)

  Try it selecting both lines in this example:

        -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;

- You can cycle through values of CSS properties.
  Try this at any stylesheet you have.

- Hayaku is CSS-aware: it would change values from `0` to `1px`,
  it won't reduce paddings less than zero, and have a lot of other small tweaks for CSS.
